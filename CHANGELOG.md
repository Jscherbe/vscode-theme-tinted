## 0.0.3 - 2025-06-26

- Fixed javascript "import" related coloring, 
- Had been testing with 'babel-javascript', this includes fixes when using vscode 'javascript' language (template literals, import keyword, etc)
- Adjust merge colors so that things like "(Incoming Change)" are visible (made overall description colors brighter to work better there [extension descriptions share this for example] without making them too bright). Not perfect for merge text but better
